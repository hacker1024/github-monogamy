# GitHub Monogamy

_Eliminate distractions and stay faithful for your spaghetti_

**Does this sound familiar?**

You open so many GitHub issues, but only a fraction of developers ever respond.

Of those that do, a large portion eventually stop replying, neglecting you in
favour of newer, fresher, more enticing bug reports!

**If so, this tool is for you.**

_GitHub Monogamy_ is a first-of-its kind feature
addressing one of the biggest challenges of securing a bugfix: Unanswered
messages from project authors.

Following a successful test, the feature requires users with too many people
waiting on their responses to take action, such as replying or closing the
issue, before continuing to accept new tickets.

Ultimately, the tool helps to get issues resolved, by supporting the the
maintainers who need help focusing, and those waiting for the conversation to
continue.

## Usage

1. Ensure that your workflows have **write access to your repository** in the
   repository settings
2. Copy the workflow in this repository into your own
3. Tweak behaviour as required. It's pretty simple.

## FAQ

### This project references _monogamy_, but it allows up to eight issues to be open at once. Why?

The industry is used to a lifestyle of unlimited open issues. We cannot expect
it to change overnight.

### How can we convince project authors to implement this scheme?

Feel free to open a friendly PR adding it to their repository!

If you feel like such a feature is too small for a dedicated PR, consider
including it one of your larger ones. That way, you don't even need to waste
the author's time by mentioning it.

### This concept sure seems familiar. Was it inspired by anything in particular?

No.
